1.1:implement an algorithm to determin if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data strcutures

1.2:Write code to reverse a C-Style String.(C-String means that "abcd" is represented as fice characters, including the null character.)

1.3:Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.

1.4:Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not anagram is not as same as Palindrome

1.5:Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20' Caution:'%20' has 3 chars is a string

1.6:Given an image represented by an N*N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the iamge by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

1.7:Write an algorithm such that if an element in an M*N matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0

1.8:Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring(i.e.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat")
